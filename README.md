### Authentication

#### 1. Signup (Register New User)
```bash
curl -X POST "https://kanika-backend-g4yx.onrender.com/auth/signup" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "securePassword123",
    "full_name": "John Doe"
  }'
```

#### 2. Login
```bash
curl -X POST "https://kanika-backend-g4yx.onrender.com/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "securePassword123"
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
